<h1>Six Senses</h1>
<ol>
<li>A human’s taste sense interacts with other senses and factors, including smell, texture, and temperature.The five basic tastes are saltiness, sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and umami.</li><br><br>
<li>A snake has no taste buds on its tongue. It uses its tongue to bring smells and tastes into its mouth. Receptors in the pits of the snake’s mouth transmit the information to the brain.The catfish has about 100,000 taste buds (the average human has about 10,000 taste buds).</li><br><br>
<li>Because tactile sensation gathers so much information, its possible to fool the brain into interpreting information incorrectly. For example, a trick called the Aristotle illusion calls for a person to cross her fingers and touch a small round object. Because the brain is not used to receiving tactile information of this sort from crossed fingers, it'll interpret the single object as two objects.</li><br><br>
<li>Dogs recognize and identify humans first by scent.Grizzly bears can smell food from up to 18 miles away.</li><br><br>
<li>Every person smells things differently. This is because of the over 900,000 genetic variations of olfactory receptors.your friend.Good smells make you happier.Odors can accelerate puberty, attract mates, and alter menstrual cycles in humans.</li><br><br>
<li>Here are some of the senses that we have other than your basic 5 sense sight, sound, taste, smell, and touch(Pressure,Itch, Temperature, Pain, Thirst, Hunger,Direction,Time,Muscle, tension, Proprioception, Equilibrioception, Stretch Receptors, Chemoreceptors)</li><br><br>
<li>Humans can hear sounds up to 20 kHz. The greater wax moth can hear sounds up to 300 kHz due to hearing sense.</li><br><br>
<li>Interestingly, our mood can affect our sense of taste, explaining various appetite changes associated with mood disorders. As with sight and sound, taste is dependent on smell.</li><br><br>
<li>Nerve endings designed to act as tactile receptors are located in the dermis of the skin and send signals to the brain, which the brain then interprets as sensations. Some areas of the body are more sensitive than others because they have more nerve endings. For example, a fingertip, one of the most sensitive parts of the body, has about 100 nerve endings.</li><br><br>
<li>One of the most challenging problems in creating realistic prosthetics is reproducing tactile sensations. Tactile sensation allows a person to know how much pressure he or she can place on an object without harming it. Without this information, people could not judge the strength of their grip until what they are holding breaks, bends, or cracks.</li><br><br>
<li>Our experiences, beliefs and culture affect what we notice out of the thousands of stimuli our senses are receiving. Our brain uses information it gathers through our five senses, interprets it and perceives the world around us, creating our life experience.</li><br><br>
<li>Our five senses are our connection to the outside world. They send messages to our brain, which interprets the messages and perceives what is around us. A majority of the information that our senses take in is never recognized by our brain</li><br><br>
<li>PubMed Health states Taste and Smell these senses are connected to the involuntary nerve system, so they can trigger bodily reactions from vomiting to salivation.</li><br><br>
<li>Science says that smells trigger memories from your childhood or from happy or bad memories.</li><br><br>
<li>Sensitivity of Sight Sense varies across the retina; it's concentrated in the macula, which is the center of view. That's why you can see your hand held straight out to the side, but you probably don't have enough acuity to count the fingers.</li><br><br>
<li>Smell Sense trigger Memories.Smell happens in humans when the brain receives signals after molecules in the air bind to sites on olfactory receptors.</li><br><br>
<li>Smell Sense trigger Memories.Smell happens in humans when the brain receives signals after molecules in the air bind to sites on olfactory receptors.</li><br><br>
<li>Tactile sensation refers to the sense of touch, specifically the information received from varying pressure or vibration against the skin. Tactile sensation is considered a somatic sensation, meaning it originates at the surface of the body, rather than internally.</li><br><br>
<li>Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are related senses. Unlike vision or hearing, there's no set range of sensitivity. The tongue can sense flavors that are sweet, sour, salty, bitter and savory. Part of the perception of flavors comes from aromas reaching olfactory nerve cells in the nostrils.</li><br><br>
<li>Taste Sense reacts when a substance reacts chemically with the receptors of taste buds, the sensation of taste is created.People lose their perception of taste as they age. By age 20, half of their taste receptors are gone (on average).</li><br><br>
<li>Temporal perception, the sense of the passage of time, and introspection, sensations coming from within organs. Equilibrioception is the sense of balance, and thermoception is the ability to feel hot and cold.</li><br><br>
<li>The 6th sense is another term for extrasensory perception. Extrasensory perception (ESP) would involve the reception of information not gained through the recognized senses and not internally originated. According to the National Science Foundation extrasensory perception is listed as pseudoscience or they can see or predict activity happens in future or past.</li><br><br>
<li>The commonly held definition of a “sense” is “any system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that respond to a specific physical phenomenon and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted.”</li><br><br>
<li>The sense of hearing is actually due to a response to mechanical stimuli; vibrations are converted into nerve impulses that the brain receives.</li><br><br>
<li>The sense of touch is part of the somatosensory system, which also includes senses of pain, tickling and itching, along with awareness of body position and movement, called proprioception. </li><br><br>
<li>The sense of touch is the first to develop in humans at about 8 weeks into the gestation period.Touch stimulates the brain to release endorphins.Blood pressure and heart rate can be reduced by a touch.</li><br><br>
<li>The sensory receptors in the skin are called Merkel cells, and they reside at the base of the epidermis and around hair follicles.Their function is similar to the nerve cells in the cochlea, turning sensations like vibrations or texture into electrical signals.</li><br><br>
<li>The traditional “5 senses” model (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste) is credited to Aristotle.</li><br><br>
<li>Touch Sense:This has been found to be distinct from pressure, temperature, pain, and even itch sensors.</li><br><br>
<li>Touch sensations can be sorted into sub-categories, such as sharp pain, aching pain, and tactile stimulations such as pressure and vibration.</li><br><br>
<li>We see when visible light is processed by the eye’s components and translated into neural impulses that are processed by the brain's Sight Sense.Human eyes are made of over two million working parts.</li><br><br>
<li>When we eat, chemical substances are dissolved by our saliva, which stimulate our sense of taste.The bumps we see are called papillae and contain multiple taste buds (10,000 in total). The information is sent by afferent nerves to the brain (the thalamus and eventually to the cortex), where we recognize the taste as either pleasant or unpleasant. </li><br><br>
<li>When you breathe in through your nose, olfactory receptors are stimulated by chemical molecules suspended in the air, and messages are sent to the olfactory bulb at the base of the brain. Smell is the sense most strongly linked to memory.</li><br><br>
