The cells that make up your body are dying and being replaced all the time. This happens so often that about every 7 years you have a completely new body of cells.</li><br><br>

<li>Human bone is an excellent example of a perfect architecture. The femur that supports the weight of our body during walking is more powerful when compared to a solid concrete of the same weight.</li><br><br>

<li>Humans are the only animals who express shock and surprise by their mouths dropping open.</li><br><br>

<li>Natural clones, also known as identical twins, occur in humans and other mammals. These twins are produced when a fertilized egg splits, creating two or more embryos that carry almost identical DNA.</li><br><br>

<li>Our bone marrow produces 260 billion red blood cells (RBCs) and 135 billion white blood cells (WBCs) per day.</li><br><br>

<li>People have over 10,000 subtle facial expressions that can express their emotions. Whats more impressive is that most people can pick up on these subtle changes. We have evolved to be able to recognize emotions via subtle changes in facial expression.</li><br><br>

<li>Studies have traced cravings for high-calorie meals back to caveman days, when hunters and gatherers needed to store energy between unpredictable mealtimes. Now our cravings for fatty and sugary foods, which release chemicals that can trigger mild euphoria, spur obesity and diabetes. </li><br><br>

<li>The relation between your thumb and your nose is - the length of your thumb is equal to the length of your nose.</li><br><br>

<li>The same skin cells that make up a human vagina are the same type of cells that are in a human mouth.</li><br><br>

<li>There are more bacteria in a human mouth than there are people in the world.During your lifetime, you will produce enough saliva to fill two swimming pools and Your nose can remember 50,000 different scents.</li><br><br>

<li>You are more similar to your siblings than you know:According to psychology, identical twins are 90% similar, fraternal twins are 75% similar and siblings brought up together are 50-75% similar, while siblings brought up in different places are 25% similar.</li><br><br>
