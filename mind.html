<h1>Mind</h1>
<ol>
<li> Creativity is not proportionate to Mind's Intelligence.Scientists suggest that a basic IQ of 90 to 110 is required for creative activity, but the level of creativity has no particular relationship with the levels of intelligence. A highly intelligent person could have low creativity and vice versa.</li><br><br>
<li> Long time use of mobile phones is linked to higher risk of brain tumors. Loss of blood from the brain for 8-10 seconds can lead to unconsciousness.</li><br><br>
<li> Drugs and alcohol interfere with the brains signaling mechanisms and have some effect on the dopamine and opiod systems, which are provide for some of our sense of pleasure and reward.</li><br><br>
<li>Ambidextrous people have a corpus collosum(the part of the brain that bridges the two halves) that is 11% larger than those who are right handed.</li><br><br>
<li>Brain is the fattest organ in the body, contains 100 billion neurons or nerve cells (15 times the total human population on earth) and a trillion glial cells and has around 150,000 miles of blood vessels.</li><br><br>
<li>Cells in your body react to everything your mind has to say. So negativity can bring down your immune system and make you fall sick more often. Stay positive, folks!</li><br><br>
<li>Everyone dreams, even blind people, for at least 1-2 hours and on an average 4-7 dreams each night. Brain waves are more active while you are dreaming than when you are awake.</li><br><br>
<li>Half of a person’s genes are responsible for the complex design of the brain with the other half describing the organization of the remaining 98% of the body.</li><br><br>
<li>If your mind wanders often, there’s a 85% chance that you’re subconsciously unhappy with your life.</li><br><br>
<li>In a study, scientists found that students who ate foods that did not contain preservatives, food additives like artificial flavors and dyes did 14% better in I.Q tests than those that consumed with these substances.</li><br><br>
<li>It takes the brain cells only 6 minutes to react to alcohol. And drinking alcohol does not make you forget anything. When you get blackout drunk, the brain temporarily loses its ability to create memories.</li><br><br>
<li>Larger the No. of Competitors, Lesser the Will to Compete.When you see that a large number of people have appeared to compete, you instantly calculate a lower probability of winning assumed by your mind.</li><br><br>
<li>Learning new things changes your brain and increase your intelligence—even if you're older.</li><br><br>
<li>Long term memory is controlled by the Vernicke speech area.</li><br><br>
<li>Mind's Intelligence may be of different types, and each type of intelligence is an individual trait, that has very little to do with the others. Intelligence could be musical, kinesthetic, emotional, mathematical, reasoning oriented or even athletic proved by psychology.</li><br><br>
<li>Music changes the way we think in our mind and our perception of the world.</li><br><br>
<li>Music triggers activity in the same part of the brain that releases the ‘pleasure chemical' dopamine during eating.</li><br><br>
<li>On an average, humans experience around 70,000 thoughts each day. Laughing at a joke requires activity in five different areas of the brain.Forgetting unnecessary things is actually good for the brain as it helps the nervous system to maintain its plasticity.</li><br><br>
<li>Our Brain Responds Differently to People We Know.Our brain usually likes responding to people who have similar tastes and preferences and more to people, we already know.</li><br><br>
<li>Sleep deprivation can affect the brain in multiple ways and can affect memory, slow down your reactions and impair judgment.</li><br><br>
<li>The average weight of a newborn human infant brain is about 350 to 400 grams, or three-quarters of a pound. That means it grows to four times its original size from infancy to adulthood.</li><br><br>
<li>The brain treats rejection like physical pain. This probably explains the reason behind approach anxiety now!</li><br><br>
<li>The cell in your body react to every time that your mind says. So negative thoughts bring down your immune system and you feel sick.</li><br><br>
<li>The human brain is a complex system of stimuli and responses. The bid to understand how this complex system works has spawned many a studies. Researchers state that our brain’s first instinct is survival. That means food,& shelter  Once survival is ensured, you can program your brain to do anything you want.</li><br><br>
<li>The human brain is composed of approximately 75 percent water, as well as fat and protein.</li><br><br
<li>The more we hear something, the more we believe it is true – it is called illusion of truth effect caused by our brain.</li><br><br>
<li>The smarter the person is, the faster he thinks in mind, and the sloppier or worst his handwriting is.</li><br><br>
<li>There are three types of long term memories:episodic(life experiences),semantic(information or knowledge) and procedural(how to do things and learned body responses).</li><br><br>
<li>When you have crush on someone your brain overlooks and ignores the flaw of that person causing them to appear “perfect”.</li><br><br>
<li>When you remember a past event, you're actually remembering the last time you remembered it.This is why our memories fade and distort over time.</li><br><br>
<li>While Brain represents only about 2 percent of the body's total weight, the brain requires about 20 percent of the body's oxygen and 25 percent of the body's glucose.</li><br><br>
<li>Your brain could fit in approximately 1 million songs, as the storage capacity of a human brain exceeds 4 terabytes(TB) according to research.</li><br><br>
<li>Your mind write monotonous speeches of boring people to make it sound interesting.</li><br><br>
